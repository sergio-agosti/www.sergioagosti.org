This is the redesign of our [company's web-site](http://theframeworks.com). I've been working very close to one of our **graphic designer**
to ensure the front-end was **fully responsive** and supported in all sort of **different devices**, from desktops with large screens to
tablets and mobile phones.

The project was very interesting and provided lots of new challenges. On the home-page, the content belongs to many different types, and it is
structured into a blocky grid. Every piece of content needs to keep its **constant ratio**, and at the same time the layout needs to be
**completely fluid**.

A lot of big images are being used across the entire website. I've developed a small and efficient JavaScript piece of code which makes sure only
an image with appropriate dimensions is loaded, to avoid waste of bandwith and poor performances especially on **mobile devices**.
A higher resolution image is also loaded if the screen is a high resolution one as well, such as **retina display** devices.
