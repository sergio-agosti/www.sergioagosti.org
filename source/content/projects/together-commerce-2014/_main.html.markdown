This is a set of landing pages for an international AD campaign for Toshiba Commerce. They follow a common, **fully responsive template**.

The entire project is based on [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/), a very powerful **static site generator**.
The data is structured in a **JSON** file and this makes maintaining the project very easy.
Every time some changes are made, before publishing them Middleman compiles everything into pure HTML files. This way there is no need for
a database server-side, and the pages are served very **fast** to the browser. Also, this approach brigs to a **minimum** the risk of **security issues**.
