A friend of mine, who is a very talented amateur photographer, asked me to help him publish a [website about his pictures](http://lucabartoliniphotography.com "Luca Bartolini Photography").
He gave me a **visual idea** on how he wanted the website to look like, and I turned it into an elegant **responsive website**.
